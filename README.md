# Snake
Classic game of "Snake" made in Java by Benjamin Dempsey 22-06-15

This game was made in the summer by a first year CPSC student at UNBC. The only known issue is with the KeyPressed function
occasionally not accepting input. This can prevent the user from being able to control the snake. The issue is not with
this project's code, but rather with Java's KeyAdapter. Alternative methods of receiving key input are being explored.

Enjoy!
